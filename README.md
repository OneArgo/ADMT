# ADMT repository
A repository for Argo Data Management Team activities.  
This is [the link to ADMT actions dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/OneArgo/projects/1). 
Please email argo@ucsd.edu for an invitation to join this project.

This is the link to the 'issues' view of the actions:  https://github.com/OneArgo/ADMT/issues.
From that viewpoint, you can search for terms in the 'Filters' line or filter by 'Label' on the right
hand side of the page.  For example, if you filter by 'DAC', all tickets assigned to DACs appear.

If you'd like to start an ADMT discussion on a topic, please go to 'Discussions' at the top and then 
click on the green 'New Discussion' button.  As we transition to using this Discussion feature, please
email the Argo DM list indicating a new discussion has started and ask people to contribute to 
it here.
