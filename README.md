# ADMT repository
This is the repository for Argo Data Management Team activities, including actions from meetings and discussions between meetings.  ADMT actions are recorded as ‘issues’ in this repository.   

This is [the link to ADMT actions dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/OneArgo/projects/1). 

Please email argo@ucsd.edu for an invitation to join this repository.

A tutorial video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elE_RuWHZH0) to help you navigate and interact with the ADMT repository.

# ADMT actions vs discussions
This ADMT repository has two purposes which are (1) the collection of all ADMT action items and (2) a place for new ADMT discussions in between ADMT meetings.  These two features are distinguished within GitHub by being an ‘issue’ (sometimes also called a ‘ticket’) OR a ‘discussion’.  Only ADMT & BGC-ADMT co-chairs should create issues as these are controlled actions that result from ADMT or AST meetings.  Anyone in the ADMT is welcome to start a discussion to request feedback on future possible actions.  Please read below to learn more about how to interact with the ADMT GitHub repository.

# Guidance for ADMT members who are interacting with actions
1) You can search for actions within the ‘issues’ list ([Issues · OneArgo/ADMT](https://github.com/OneArgo/ADMT/issues) ) in the ‘Filters’ line or filter by ‘Label’ on the right hand side of the page.
2) Alternately, you can review categories of actions on the ADMT actions dashboard (https://github.com/orgs/OneArgo/projects/1 ).
3) Discuss the action by writing a comment at the bottom of the issue/action.  You need to be signed into GitHub to comment.
4) If there is a ‘check box’ in the issue and it applies to you, please check the box when it is completed.
3) Once an action has been completed, either an ‘Assignee’ or the ADMT co-chairs should summarize the work done so that readers do not have to read the full thread back to know what to do.
5) Completed actions can then be closed either by an ‘Assignee’ or the ADMT co-chairs.


# Guidance for ADMT members who want to start a discussion within the ADMT
Any ADMT member who is signed into GitHub can start a ‘Discussion’ by clicking on ‘Discussions’ in the bar above and then on ‘New discussion’.  There are different types of discussions available, so choose the one that is appropriate for your situation.  The ‘general’ discussion would be appropriate when you wish to request feedback on an issue or document prior to an ADMT meeting or have a proposal for a change in flagging, or any other issue you would like raised to the ADMT.
As the ADMT transitions to GitHub, please consider opening the discussion and then emailing the Argo data management and/or BGC Argo email lists with a link to the discussion and request for feedback.
Please assign labels as appropriate to your discussion.
After the discussion has received feedback, been presented at an ADMT meeting (if needed) and resolved, the member who started the discussion is please asked to ‘close’ the discussion.

# The importance of a label
* Labels are used for proper management of issues and filtering for review, action follow-up, etc.
* Each issue should be flagged with the appropriate label for good management and labeling can evolve as discussion progresses.
* Each label has a short description of its meaning.
* While anyone is able to label issues using existing labels, it is the responsibility of the ADMT co-chairs to regularly review and update issue labeling.
